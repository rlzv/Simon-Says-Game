# Simon-Says-Game
  This project is using jquery library and it is simple to play. We start the game by pressing any button on the keyboard. The game is pointing to a button on the screen, either green, red, yellow or blue using an flash effect and each color coresponds to a sound. You need to keep track to which button was last pressed + the new one, so, if the game says green, you press green, next if it says red, you need to press the buttons in order so firstly green and after that, red and so on. The game difficulty increases as you progress into the game.
  
  
  The code is explained in app.js file but mainly what it's there is that we listen to keypress on the entire page and we listen to button clicks via 2 anonymous functions. We start the game logic by checking the answer for the current level and if what the game provided coresponds to what the user clicked, we move on and we log a "succes" and we continue the game after 1000ms(1s) and if the user was wrong it needs to restart the game if it wants to play again. Into nextSequence function we store what the user enters into an array and we increment the level if it plays the game correctly. The rest of the function that exists there are for integrating the sounds for the game, for animaton when you click on a button and the functions that restarts the game.
